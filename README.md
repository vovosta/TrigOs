Today guys is trated the bootloader, to be honest copy pasted one from a github repo but i'm currently studying the code to really understand, because understand is the real project. I'll publish the boot.asm file so you take a look on what i'm studying right now. Comments will may be in french because i'm a french speaker so...
Also i bought a book, https://www.amazon.com/dp/2412066965/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?psc=1&aref=bvb8b8mFqX&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9kZXRhaWw it's this one so like that i can also learn C while sutdying the bootloader. 
I don't even if he works but i'll compile it only when i'll have finish and if there's any problems i'll try to resolve it.
Hope to rewrite fast because since a long time i haven't done a commit. Bye guys.
